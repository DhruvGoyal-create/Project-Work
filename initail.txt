To use this component, ensure you have React and Tailwind CSS set up in your project.

Also, install lucide-react for the icons: npm install lucide-react

This is a simplified version and can be expanded with more features as needed.

Example usage in your main application file:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import YTMusicClone from './YTMusicClone';
import './index.css'; // Ensure Tailwind CSS is imported

ReactDOM.render(<YTMusicClone />, document.getElementById('root'))
